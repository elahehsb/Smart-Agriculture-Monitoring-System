# Smart-Agriculture-Monitoring-System

##### Overview


This project involves developing a comprehensive Smart Agriculture Monitoring System that leverages IoT sensors, data analysis, machine learning, and cloud-based deployment to monitor and optimize agricultural practices. The system will gather data from various sensors placed in the field, process and analyze the data, and provide actionable insights through an interactive web interface.

##### System Architecture
Components:

###### 1. IoT Sensors: Collecting real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, etc.
###### 2. Data Ingestion: Acquiring data from IoT sensors and transmitting it to the cloud.
###### 3. Data Processing: Using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time processing.
###### 4. Data Analysis: Performing data analysis and generating insights.
###### 5. Machine Learning: Implementing models to predict crop yield and optimize irrigation.
###### 6. Data Storage: Using PostgreSQL for storing historical data.
###### 7. Web Application: Interactive frontend for data visualization and farmer notifications.
###### 8. Deployment: Using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
